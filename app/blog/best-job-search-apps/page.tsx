              </li>
              <li>

                <strong>Professional Network:</strong> Maintain an active LinkedIn profile for networking

              <li>Use 15% for networking and professional development</li>
              <li>Set specific times for checking apps to avoid constant distraction</li>
            </ul>

              The right job search apps can significantly accelerate your path to employment, especially when looking

              complete and updated profiles, and use smart notification systems to stay ahead of the competition.
              Remember that consistency and persistence are key – check your apps regularly, apply quickly to new
              postings, and don't rely on just one platform.
