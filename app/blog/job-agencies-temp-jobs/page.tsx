          When you're looking for work, especially if you need a job quickly or want to gain experience in a new field,
          job agencies and temporary staffing can be invaluable resources. These services act as intermediaries between
          job seekers and employers, streamlining the hiring process and opening doors to opportunities you might not
          find on your own.

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">What are Job Agencies and Temp Agencies?</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Job Agencies (Recruitment Agencies):</strong> These firms specialize in connecting job seekers with
            employers for permanent positions. They often work with companies to fill specific roles, from entry-level
            to executive. They typically get paid by the employer once a candidate is successfully placed.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Temporary Staffing Agencies (Temp Agencies):</strong> These agencies focus on placing individuals in
            temporary, contract, or "temp-to-perm" roles. They employ the workers directly and then "lease" them to
            client companies for a specified period or project.

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Access to Unadvertised Jobs:</strong> Many companies use agencies to fill positions discreetly or
              before they are publicly advertised.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Expert Guidance:</strong> Recruiters can offer resume critiques, interview coaching, and career
              advice tailored to your skills and the market.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Time-Saving:</strong> Agencies do the legwork of finding suitable openings, submitting your
              application, and often scheduling interviews.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Negotiation Support:</strong> For permanent roles, recruiters can assist with salary and benefits
              negotiations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No Cost to Job Seekers:</strong> Their services are free for you, as employers pay their fees.

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Benefits of Temporary Jobs</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">Temp jobs offer a flexible and strategic way to gain employment and experience:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Quick Employment:</strong> Temp agencies often have immediate openings, allowing you to start
              working much faster than traditional job searching.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Gain Experience:</strong> Ideal for entry-level job seekers or those looking to transition into a
              new industry without long-term commitment.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Skill Development:</strong> Learn new skills on the job and add diverse experiences to your

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>"Try Before You Buy":</strong> For both you and the employer, a temp-to-perm arrangement allows
              you to assess if the company culture and role are a good fit before committing to a permanent position.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Flexibility:</strong> Choose assignments that fit your schedule, whether you need short-term,
