            <h2>Why Use Job Agencies for Immediate Hiring?</h2>
            <p>
              Job agencies, also known as staffing agencies or employment agencies, specialize in connecting job seekers
              with employers. They often have exclusive access to job openings that aren't publicly advertised and can
              fast-track your application, especially for temporary or temp-to-hire roles.
            </p>
            <p>
              For those seeking immediate employment, agencies are invaluable. They handle the initial screening,
              interview scheduling, and often provide resume tips, significantly speeding up your job search.
            </p>
