          <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Benefits of Working Overnight/Night Shifts</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">Beyond the unconventional hours, night shifts can offer several appealing advantages:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Higher Pay (Shift Differential):</strong> Many employers offer a higher hourly wage for night
              shifts to incentivize employees, known as a "shift differential" or "night premium."
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Fewer Distractions:</strong> A quieter work environment with fewer meetings and less foot traffic
              can lead to increased focus and productivity.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Better Work-Life Balance for Some:</strong> Daytimes are free for appointments, errands, childcare
              (if a partner works days), or pursuing hobbies when others are at work.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Reduced Commute:</strong> Less traffic during off-peak hours can mean a quicker and less stressful
              commute.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Increased Independence:</strong> Often, there's less direct supervision, allowing for more
              autonomy in completing tasks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Faster Career Progression:</strong> Sometimes, there are fewer applicants for night shifts,
              potentially making it easier to get hired or advance.

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Problem-Solving Skills:</strong> Being able to handle unexpected issues independently or with
