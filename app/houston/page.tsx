              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Houston offers a relatively low cost of living compared to other major metropolitan areas, particularly
                when it comes to housing. The city is known for its vibrant culture, diverse culinary scene, and
                numerous parks and recreational facilities. While traffic can be a factor, the extensive highway system
                and growing public transit options help connect the sprawling city. Houston's lack of state income tax
                is another financial benefit for residents.
