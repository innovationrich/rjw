    content: `
      <div class="prose max-w-none">
        <p>Passive income is the holy grail of financial freedom—money that continues to flow even when you're not actively working. While building passive income streams requires initial effort and sometimes investment, the long-term benefits of earning money while you sleep are transformative.</p>
        
        <h2>Why Passive Income Works in 2025</h2>
        <p>Digital platforms have democratized passive income creation. With over 4.9 billion internet users worldwide, there's an unprecedented opportunity to create scalable income streams that reach global audiences without traditional barriers.</p>
        
        <h2>How to Get Started (From $0)</h2>
        <h3>1. Assess Your Resources</h3>

        <h3>2. Choose Low-Cost/No-Cost Strategies</h3>
        <p>Focus on passive income methods that require more time than money initially, such as content creation, affiliate marketing, or digital products.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Start Small and Reinvest</h3>
        <p>Begin with one income stream, reinvest early profits into growth, and gradually add new streams as you build capital.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Automate and Scale</h3>
        <p>Use tools and systems to automate processes, allowing your income streams to run with minimal ongoing intervention.</p>
        
        <h2>Realistic Earning Expectations</h2>
        <p>Passive income builds over time. Here's what you might expect:</p>

          <li><strong>Months 7-12:</strong> $500-2,000/month (scaling phase)</li>
          <li><strong>Year 2+:</strong> $2,000+/month (optimization phase)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Top Passive Income Strategies</h2>

        <h3>2. Digital Product Sales</h3>
        <p>Create once, sell repeatedly. E-books, courses, templates, and digital tools can generate ongoing revenue.</p>
        <p><strong>Getting Started:</strong> Identify a problem you can solve, create a digital solution, and sell on platforms like Gumroad or Etsy.</p>
        
        <h3>3. YouTube Channel Monetization</h3>

          <li><strong>Ignoring audience building:</strong> Without an audience, you have no one to sell to</li>
          <li><strong>Creating low-quality products:</strong> Quality determines long-term success and reputation</li>
          <li><strong>Not reinvesting profits:</strong> Use early earnings to accelerate growth</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Analyze what's working and double down</li>
          <li>Automate repetitive tasks</li>
          <li>Outsource content creation and management</li>
          <li>Expand into related niches or products</li>
          <li>Build email lists for direct marketing</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
