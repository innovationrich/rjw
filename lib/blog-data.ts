      <p>Passive income is the holy grail of financial freedom – money that flows into your bank account with minimal ongoing effort. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore 15 proven passive income strategies that can help you build wealth while you sleep.</p>
      
      <h2>What is Passive Income?</h2>
      <p>Passive income refers to earnings that require little to no daily effort to maintain. Unlike active income from a traditional job, passive income streams continue generating money even when you're not actively working.</p>
      
      <h2>1. Real Estate Passive Income</h2>
      <p>Real estate remains one of the most reliable sources of passive income. Here's how to invest in real estate for passive income:</p>
      
      <h3>Rental Properties</h3>
      <p>Owning rental properties provides monthly cash flow through rent payments. The key is finding properties in growing markets with strong rental demand.</p>
      
      <h3>Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)</h3>
      <p>REITs allow you to invest in real estate without directly owning property. They typically pay dividends of 4-8% annually and trade like stocks.</p>
      
      <h3>Passive Income from Land</h3>
      <p>Raw land can generate passive income through:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Agricultural leasing to farmers</li>
        <li>Billboard advertising rights</li>
        <li>Cell tower leasing</li>
        <li>Hunting and recreation leases</li>
        <li>Solar panel installations</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>2. Dividend Stocks and ETFs</h2>
      <p>Building a portfolio of dividend-paying stocks creates a steady income stream. The best dividend stocks for passive income typically include:</p>
      
      <h3>Dividend ETFs for Passive Income</h3>
      <p>Dividend ETFs offer diversification and professional management. Popular options include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG)</li>
        <li>SPDR S&P Dividend ETF (SDY)</li>
        <li>iShares Select Dividend ETF (DVY)</li>
        <li>Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>These dividend ETFs typically yield 2-4% annually and provide exposure to hundreds of dividend-paying companies.</p>
